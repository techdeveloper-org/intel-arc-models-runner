# Resume checkpoint

Read this first in a new session. Tracking issue: [#42](https://github.com/techdeveloper-org/intel-arc-models-runner/issues/42). Branch: `claude/nice-volta-bs7mnf`. Plan: `docs/plans/MASTER_PLAN_v4.md` (sections 17-22 are current).

## State (2026-10-29)

| Slice | Record | State |
|:--|:--|:--|
| S-A honesty | `stages/S-A-honesty/STAGE.md` | done in the cloud |
| S-B memory safety | `stages/S-B-memory-safety/STAGE.md` | done in the cloud; Windows DLL rebuild pending (local) |
| S-C ring buffer and lifetime | `stages/S-C-ring-and-lifetime/STAGE.md` | done in the cloud; TLC run pending (local) |
| S-D engine and Level Zero | `stages/S-D-engine-and-level-zero/STAGE.md` | done against a fake loader; real-driver run pending (local) |
| S-E benchmarks | `stages/S-E-benchmarks/STAGE.md` | statistics, gates, schema, harnesses done; no result files yet (local) |
| S-F docs, version, CI | `stages/S-F-docs-and-release-prep/STAGE.md` | done; release not done |

Version is 0.2.0 in the tree but nothing is tagged or published; tagging, merging and publishing need the maintainer's explicit approval.

## What only the maintainer can do (real machine)

1. Rebuild the Windows DLL and commit it with its sidecar: `python src/arc_runner/native/build_native.py`, then `pytest -m "not hardware"` and `pytest -m hardware`; commit `libarc_native_sys.dll` and `libarc_native_sys.dll.build.json`.
2. `python scripts/probe_hardware.py > probe.json`; commit the JSON.
3. Run the benchmark matrix with at least 3 warmups and 10 timed runs per system, write schema-v1 files to `docs/benchmarks/results/`, run `python scripts/render_bench_docs.py`.
4. `python scripts/bench_regression.py --baseline c7312e0 --workload llm --model-dir <dir> --device GPU`.
5. Run TLC on the ring model: `java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC -workers 4 -config docs/formal/RingSlots.cfg docs/formal/RingSlots.tla`.
6. Decide on merge, tag and release.

## Open technical items

Speculative engine context-window check; u8 KV quality gate (KL on a fixed prompt set); `try_pin` not wired into the streamer; USM/DMA path not used by streaming; Sysman power/frequency telemetry; multi-domain benchmark scripts still write legacy JSON; independent test authorship (all tests so far written by the implementing sessions, checked by mutation).

## Commands that must pass before a push

```bash
python -m pytest -m "not hardware" -q
python scripts/check_docs_sync.py
python scripts/check_delivery_docs.py
python scripts/validate_bench_json.py
```
